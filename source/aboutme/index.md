# üíª About me

A Pwner plays for [~~TheRoundTable~~](https://ctftime.org/team/194346) [Alternative f√ºr Knights](https://ctftime.org/team/369824).

I'm interested in `Binary Exploitation`. Now I'm focusing on `Linux kernel exploitation`.

Writing detailed write-ups takes a lot of time, so I couldn't document all the challenges I‚Äôve solved. If you want to know which CTF events I‚Äôve participated in, check out these links:
